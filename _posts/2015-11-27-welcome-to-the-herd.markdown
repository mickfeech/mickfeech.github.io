A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend the [#DevOpsDaysOhio](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-ohio/) conference and it was so enlightening for to talk with all the practitioners in the DevOps arena.  For those that don't know I was the technical subject matter expert for my organizations Java application server environment for a number of years until I transitioned into a role within our EA organization shepherding our application server and middleware domain.  

I had tried to introduce continuous integration and continuous delivery concepts (without knowing it) during my tenure as an engineer back in 2013.  I had even spoke at IBM's Impact conference about it; it was titled "Lightweight WebSphere Application Server Deployment Automation".  The high level overview was that by mixing perl and JRuby I developed a lightweight resuable framework for installing and deploying (with configurations) WAS and IHS across our environment.  We leveraged other freely availables tools, like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/), we were able to handle the rapid growth of our infrastructure with a reusable and consistent method to install our software stack.  Automating the deployment of this stack got us down from two or three day installation and configurations to about 15 minutes.  This could have been real game changing for us; unfortunately the rigorous environment that we operated in left little time to do much more than initial pass (and management wasn't willing or able to prioritize it).
