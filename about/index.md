Currently I'm a technology architect with a total of 10 years IT experience.  I've done adminstration of large scale application server deployments within that 10 years.  I'm currently working on my Master's of Digital Science degree at Kent State University, in Ohio, with a focus on Enterprise Architecture.  I dabble in many technologies and am always looking for something new to learn.
